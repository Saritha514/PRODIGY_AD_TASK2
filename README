✅ Pro To-Do – Task Management Web Application
📌 Project Overview

Pro To-Do is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web-based task management application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application helps users organize their daily tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, edit, complete, filter, and delete tasks.

The project was developed as part of my internship to strengthen my front-end development skills and gain practical experience in building interactive web applications.

The app also supports dark mode, local storage, and real-time task statistics, making it suitable for daily productivity management.
